This is a Bug Report System that currently utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and PHP. The purpose of this website is to let users input bugs/errors into a database. 

Users are able to:
- Start a new bug report
- Close the report 
- View the process/status of the bug repair with e-mails notifying them at each stage/step.

Other features:
- Each user will have to login with a valid username and password to gain access to the bug report form. 
- Graph that displays what types of bugs have occurred in the past and how often they have occurred. 
- When a bug is fixed, the developer who reported it and every other developer involved gets a notification via email.
