                        The frequency of reporting bugs of the project depends on the current progress of your project. If there are any defects or bugs that are found attempt to immediately
                        post a report allowing others in the team to get notified of the issue.

                    <p>
                        Once logged in, there is a button that allows you or your team members to enter the name/subject of the current bug, and a textbox to write a detailed summary of the issue.
                        Furthermore, there would be timeline to show when each bug is discovered during the sprint, and which defects to prioritize.
